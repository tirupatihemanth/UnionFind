UnionFind is an algorithm that is used to solve the connectivity problem.  In this repository one can find the source code for UnionFind Algorithm and for the scalability reasons this UnionFind algorithm has been improved in different ways
The order of efficiency is as follows from lower efficiency to higher efficiency: 
QucikFind.java=>QuickUnion.java=>WeightedQuickUnion.java=>WeightCompressedQuickUnion.java
In QuickFind.java we have N*N array access for a problem of size N in union method this has been improved by implementing trees and roots concept in QuickUnion.java and this has been further improved by implementing our intuition that trees are more nearer to the root if smaller trees are joined to the roots of larger trees rather than the viceversa and this is further improved by implementing tree compression in the algorithm.,
If you have any doubts and clarifications please have a look at my post in <a href="http://hemog007.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/union-find-algorithm-and-improving-its-efficiency/" target = "blank">my blog</a> and you can comment out there.., Thank you..,
